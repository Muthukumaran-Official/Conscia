# üõ°Ô∏è   CONSCIA
**Building an Ethical and Responsible Tech Environment**

---

## üìå Overview
CONSCIA is a **multi-module cybersecurity & monitoring suite** designed for the hackathon theme:  
**‚ÄúGoverning AI ‚Äì Building Ethical and Responsible Tech Environment.‚Äù**

This toolkit focuses on **security, transparency, and ethical AI governance** by offering tools that:  
- Detect hidden data manipulation in AI inputs.  
- Monitor file & process integrity.  
- Secure sensitive data and credentials.  
- Audit network activity to prevent misuse.  
- Provide red-team simulations for resilience testing.  

Together, these modules promote **trustworthy AI adoption** by ensuring AI systems are protected from tampering, unauthorized access, and hidden malicious instructions.
